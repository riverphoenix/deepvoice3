# Deep Voice 3

## Fork of https://github.com/Kyubyong/deepvoice3 implementation

## **Work In Progress**

This is a tensorflow implementation of [DEEP VOICE 3: 2000-SPEAKER NEURAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07654.pdf). For now I'm focusing on single speaker synthesis.

### Data

I use [The LJ Speech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset).
